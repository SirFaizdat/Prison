# Prison 2 Contributing Guide

### 1. Pull Requests

Due to the fact that there is not yet a Spigot repository, I am unable to use Maven. To contribute, clone the repository and download and add the following dependencies to your project:

- Spigot 1.8
- WorldEdit
- Multiverse-Core
- Vault
- Prison

Then you will be free to add and submit pull requests! Thanks in advance!

### 2. Issues

When submitting an issue that isn't a feature request, you must follow the boilerplate issue that is automatically placed in the issue box. You must also explain EXACTLY what is happening on your end (are there any messages in console? are there any messages in the in-game chat?). A maintainer will help you solve the issue, and may or may not ask for files related to the issue to be sent in a ZIP file, either via attaching the file to a GitHub issue comment or by providing us with a download link to obtain the files.
