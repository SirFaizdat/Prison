Prison is an awesome Bukkit plugin for CraftBukkit / Spigot 1.8. It combines the mines and ranks systems essential to Prison servers into **one plugin** and allows you to set both of them up in a **very simple way**. It can be downloaded on [Bukkit](http://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/mcprison/) and [Spigot](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/prison.1223/). *Betas* can be found [here](http://github.com/SirFaizdat/Prison/releases).

## EOL
Prison 2 has reached it's End Of Life. This means there will be no more updates, and we will not support users still on Prison 2. We highly recommend upgrading to Prison 3, the best Prison yet. Click [here](https://github.com/MC-Prison/Prison) to see our GitHub repository for Prison 3.

Thank you for all of your support during Prison 2's lifetime! With your help, we can make Prison 3 the best Prison plugin out there.
